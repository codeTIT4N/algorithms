# big O complexity

### Definition

Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based on input. It is not
meant to be an exact measurement. It will not tell you how many CPU cycles it takes, instead it is meant
to generalize the growth of your algorithm.

### Some pointers

- Worst case time complexity is expressed in big Oh.
- Growth is with respect to the input.
- Constants are dropped. So, O(10n) is same as O(n)
- It is not always about using the smallest Big O alogrithm because in some cases a comparatively larger Big Oh
  algorithm might be more efficient.

- Here: The last two algorithms with complexities O(2<sup>n</sup>) and O(n!) are algorithms which are typically run on non traditional computers(i.e., supercomputers, etc).
